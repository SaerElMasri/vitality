<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./README/title5.svg"/>

### Vitality is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [React Native framework](https://reactnative.dev). React Native is a JavaScript framework that is open-source and created for the development of apps on various platforms such as iOS, Android, and web applications, using the same code base. It is built on top of React and incorporates all of its features into mobile app development.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) package which allows users to store, organize, and manage data in a structured manner using SQL (Structured Query Language).
- The app uses a variety of APIs, including the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Search-Recipes-Complex), which has a large database of over 5,000 recipes with their macro-nutrient information. It also utilizes [ExerciseDB](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb), a database containing all types of exercises filtered by target muscle, as well as the [Fitness Calcualtor](https://rapidapi.com/malaaddincelik/api/fitness-calculator), which provides users with the exact amount of calories they should consume based on various stats. Additionally, the app accesses the [Nutrition by API-Ninjas](https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/nutrition-by-api-ninjas), which displays macro-nutrient information for each food.
